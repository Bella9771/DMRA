# DMRA_RGBD-SOD
Code repository for our paper entilted "Depth-induced Multi-scale Recurrent Attention Network for Saliency Detection" accepted at ICCV 2019 (poster).

## DUT-RGBD Dataset 
We create a large scale RGB-D dataset with 1200 paired images containing more complex scenarios, such as multiple or transparent objects, similar foreground and background, complex background, low-intensity environment. This challenging dataset can contribute to comprehensively evaluating saliency models.      
+ **And we split the dataset including 800 training set and 400 test set.**
